	<h1>Textmail Privacy</h1>

	<p>Textmail, Inc. (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is the developer of the Textmail applications (“Textmail”, “Apps”, or “App”) and our website at https://textmail.app (“Website”), collectively known as our “Services”. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all personal data we collect through our Services. By using our Website or Apps, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.</p>

	<p>1. Information we collect
		We take your privacy very seriously and our general product philosophy is to avoid collecting your personal information when possible, and we design our Apps to store your data on your device. We rely on sales of software licenses to sustain our business, rather than collecting and monetizing your data. This section describes some of the cases in which we do collect personal data.</p>

		<p>App Waiting List and Email Marketing List Signup
			When you join our beta program, or subscribe to any of our marketing communications, we collect your email address. We utilize a third-party service to store this information and manage our email marketing lists. We do not sell or disclose any portion of our email list to any third parties, with the exception of our mailing list management service as necessary to distribute emails.</p>

			<p>License Restoration
				If you purchase a license directly from us, we retain the email address you provide us with at the time of purchase. When you attempt to restore a license for an existing purchase in our Apps, the email address you input is sent to our servers for license verification.</p>

				<p>If you choose the option to check for the availability of a site license within the App, the domain of your email address is sent to our servers for license verification.</p>

				<p>Social Media
					When you interact with our social media accounts on sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram, we may collect personal data that you elect to make available through your settings on the social media site, such as the content of a message you post and your profile name.</p>

					<p>Support Requests
						When handling support requests, we collect your name, email address and any information you provide voluntarily (such as a description of your problem, a copy of a message exhibiting a problem, crash logs, or other diagnostic information).</p>

						<p>2. Handling of email data
							Our Apps are local email clients that run on your device and require access to your email account(s) in order to perform their stated function. Our Apps communicate directly with your email account’s configured server to synchronize your email data and make modifications at your direction (e.g. sending a message or marking a message as read).</p>

							<p>We do not operate any servers or hosted services that have access to your account or have copies of your email content. Our Apps do not transmit any of your email content to any server besides your email account’s configured server (as necessary to offer the stated functionality of the application).</p>

							<p>When you add an email account to the App, your authentication credentials are stored in your device’s Keychain and cached email content is stored in a local database on your device. Your email data is not used to display ads.</p>

							<p>The App’s use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google’s Limited Use Requirements.</p>

							<p>3. How we use personal data
								We use the collected personal data outlined in Section 1 primarily to perform the functions indicated in that section.</p>

								<p>However, we may additionally use the personal data collected for the following legitimate business interests:</p>

								<p>To administer and protect our business and the Services, prevent fraud, criminal activity, and misuses of our Services.
									To comply with legal obligations and legal process.
									To contact you with important notices, such as communications about critical software updates or changes to our policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with our Services, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
									To analyze your interactions with our Services to maintain and improve the quality and functionality of our Services, develop our business, and inform our marketing strategy.</p>

									<p>4. Data Retention
										We retain the information you have provided to us for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, or as required by law, whichever is the longer.</p>

										<p>If you have elected to join our waitlist or receive marketing communications from us, we retain your contact information and marketing preferences indefinitely until you opt out of these communications.</p>

										<p>If you purchase a license directly from us, we retain your e-mail address indefinitely in order to authenticate your purchase when you install the App.</p>

										<p>If you contact us for support, we retain information about your request indefinitely, to have context for future interactions and to better understand support drivers for our Services.</p>

										<p>You may contact us at any time to request removal of your personal data; see the Contact section below.</p>

										<p>5. Minors
											Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 18. By using our Services, you represent that you are at least 18, or that you are the parent or guardian of a minor over the age of 13 and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services.</p>

											<p>If we become aware that personal information from minors has been collected without parental consent, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.</p>

											<p>If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided personal data to us, please contact us and we will attempt to promptly remove such information.</p>

											<p>6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
												We may change this Privacy Policy in the future, to improve clarity or to reflect changes in our product or business. When we do, we will post an updated version on this page, including the date that the policy was last updated. By continuing to use our Apps and Website, or providing us with personal data, you consent to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

												<p>7. Contacting Us
													If you have questions or concerns, you may contact us by email at hello@textmail.app</p>

													<p>You are welcome to contact us by email to request that we remove your personal data from our systems, or simply to inquire what personal data we may have stored. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your request is handled in a timely fashion.</p>
